name: vetro-frosted-glass
description: Implement the Vetro frosted-glass material (dock capsules, round buttons, notification plates, dropdown panels) in Jetpack Compose on top of the Kyant backdrop library. Use when the user wants a matte, diffuse "frosted" surface that stays readable over moving content, with exact blur/tint/grain/rim/highlight/shadow values for dark and light themes.

# Vetro frosted glass — implementation skill

You are implementing a **material**, not a translucent rectangle. Follow this document literally; every number
below was taken from a shipping Android app (Vetro) and is tuned. The reference implementation is in `GUIDE.txt`
of the same archive — read it before writing code and copy it unless the user's code base forces a deviation.

## 0. Decide first: is this the right glass?

There are two different glass materials, do not mix them up:

| Material | Look | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Liquid** (lens refraction, almost no blur) | content under it is magnified/refracted and still readable | a dock over a list of covers |
| **Frosted** (this skill: strong blur + tint + grain) | content under it is *diffused*, text on top stays readable | plates carrying text, menus, notifications, buttons over busy art |

Use frosted when letters will sit on top of it. Never put a frosted surface over a flat solid fill: with nothing
to diffuse it is just an opaque rectangle no matter how large the blur radius is. It needs real content under it
(a list, covers, a video frame).

## 1. Stack and versions (verified)

- Kotlin 2.4.21, Android Gradle Plugin 8.13.2, Compose BOM 2025.12.00, compileSdk/targetSdk 36, minSdk 26
- `io.github.kyant0:backdrop:1.0.0` — provides `layerBackdrop`, `drawBackdrop`, `blur`, `colorControls`, `Highlight`, `Shadow`
- Real blur needs **Android 12 (API 31)**. Below that, use the deliberate fallback material (section 5), never a fake.

Imports you will need:

```kotlin
import com.kyant.backdrop.Backdrop
import com.kyant.backdrop.backdrops.layerBackdrop
import com.kyant.backdrop.backdrops.rememberLayerBackdrop
import com.kyant.backdrop.drawBackdrop
import com.kyant.backdrop.effects.blur
import com.kyant.backdrop.effects.colorControls
import com.kyant.backdrop.highlight.Highlight
import com.kyant.backdrop.shadow.Shadow
```

Check the license of the backdrop library before shipping and keep its attribution.

## 2. The eight layers (order matters)

| # | Layer | How it is built |
| - | ----- | --------------- |
| 1 | live backdrop | `drawBackdrop(backdrop)` — a real recording of the scene under the surface |
| 2 | local blur | `blur(radiusPx)`, clipped to the surface shape |
| 3 | saturation + contrast | `colorControls(contrast, saturation)` — keeps colour alive after blur |
| 4 | neutral tint | `onDrawSurface = { drawRect(tint) }` — drawn AFTER the blur |
| 5 | micro-grain 1–3 % | `onDrawFront` — a cached 128x128 achromatic noise tile |
| 6 | rim, exactly one physical pixel | `border(1px, rim, shape)` — **1 physical px, not 1 dp** |
| 7 | inner highlight on the top edge | `highlight = Highlight(width = 0.75.dp, alpha = …)` |
| 8 | wide, weak shadow | `shadow = Shadow(radius = …, color = black @ low alpha)` |

Hard rules:

1. **Blur happens before tint.** Tint goes in `onDrawSurface`, i.e. on top of the processed backdrop. Never mix
   the tint into the backdrop beneath the blur.
2. **Blur before colour controls** inside `effects { }`. The reverse order smears already boosted saturation into a
   dirty halo.
3. Grain is **achromatic** and weak (alpha 0.014–0.022). Visible grain is decoration, not material. Its job is to
   kill banding on the blur gradient. Build the tile once per process with a fixed seed (`Random(0x5E7B0)`,
   grey = 128 ± 64) so screenshots are reproducible.
4. The rim is one **physical** pixel: `with(density) { 1f.toDp() }`. 1 dp is 3–4 px on a dense screen and turns the
   hairline into a fat frame.

## 3. Material values

Per-role materials, not one "glass" with ad-hoc alphas scattered across components (that is how glass turns to mush).

### dock — capsules, round buttons, dropdown panels (blur 20 dp)

|  | dark | light |
| --- | --- | --- |
| blur | 20 dp | 20 dp |
| saturation / contrast | 1.20 / 1.06 | 1.18 / 1.05 |
| tint | `#141414` @ 0.48 | white @ 0.54 |
| grain alpha | 0.020 | 0.014 |
| rim | white @ 0.14 | white @ 0.90 |
| highlight (0.75 dp) | alpha 0.55 | alpha 0.75 |
| shadow | radius 30 dp, black @ 0.26 | radius 28 dp, black @ 0.14 |
| fallback fill (API < 31) | `#1A1A1A` | `#F2F2F4` |

### notification — plates that carry body text (blur 24 dp, denser tint)

|  | dark | light |
| --- | --- | --- |
| blur | 24 dp | 24 dp |
| saturation / contrast | 1.18 / 1.05 | 1.16 / 1.04 |
| tint | `#121212` @ 0.62 | white @ 0.66 |
| grain alpha | 0.022 | 0.016 |
| rim | white @ 0.16 | white @ 0.85 |
| highlight | alpha 0.50 | alpha 0.70 |
| shadow | radius 28 dp, black @ 0.22 | radius 26 dp, black @ 0.12 |
| fallback fill | `#1C1C1E` | white |

### playerControl — buttons over cover art (theme independent: the backdrop is the picture, not the app)

blur 24 dp, saturation 1.16, contrast 1.05, tint `#141414` @ 0.42, grain 0.020, rim white @ 0.16, highlight 0.50,
shadow radius 24 dp black @ 0.22, fallback `#E6202020`.

### stackedNotification — a plate lying UNDER the top one in a stack

Same as notification but `blur = 0`, saturation = contrast = 1, tint fully opaque (`#1C1C1E` / white),
grain 0, no highlight, no shadow. Opaque on purpose: through a translucent stack the text of lower plates shows
through and turns into noise.

## 4. Structure rules (these cause the nasty bugs)

1. One `rememberLayerBackdrop()` per screen; the scrolling content gets `Modifier.layerBackdrop(backdrop)`.
   Every glass surface is a **sibling** of that content (drawn after it), never its ancestor.
2. **Never structurally add or remove a modifier node above a `layerBackdrop`** at runtime (for example a
   `Modifier.blur` that appears only when radius > 0, or a conditional `.then(...)`). Toggle *properties* of a
   permanent node instead. A changed node set resets the backdrop recording and the glass collapses into a flat fill.
3. Keep the glass modifier chain constant for the whole life of a composable. Choose branches (API level, theme)
   once with `remember(...)`, not per frame.
4. `DropdownMenu` / `Popup` are separate windows: the screen's `layerBackdrop` cannot be read from there and the
   menu comes out solid. Draw dropdown panels **inside** the screen as siblings of the content.
5. `drawBackdrop` creates a new shape provider on every call without `equals`; any recomposition would rebuild the
   `RenderEffect` and repaint the shadow. Remember the whole modifier chain keyed by
   `(backdrop, shape, material, blurPx, noiseBrush)`.
6. Moving the glass: translate with `Modifier.offset { }` or by animating the surface's own position. Wrapping the
   backdrop-providing content in a `graphicsLayer` that changes at runtime was observed to flatten the glass.

## 5. API < 31 fallback

`RenderEffect.createBlurEffect` exists from Android 12. Below that do **not** imitate blur with a grey
translucent rectangle. Use a deliberate, denser material: `background(material.fallbackFill, shape)` plus the
grain overlay. Decide the branch once (`Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.S`).

## 6. What to build

1. `FrostedMaterial` (immutable data class: blur, saturation, contrast, tint, noiseAlpha, rim, highlight, shadow,
   fallbackFill).
2. `FrostedMaterials` with `dock(isDark)`, `notification(isDark)`, `stackedNotification(isDark)`, `playerControl()`.
3. `Modifier.frostedGlass(backdrop, shape, material)` exactly as in `GUIDE.txt`.
4. A demo screen: scrolling list of colourful cards under a capsule dock, a round button, a notification plate and a
   dropdown panel, in light and dark. Without colourful moving content you cannot judge the result.

Adapt names/packages to the user's project, keep the numbers.

## 7. Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Text on the plate is readable over a high-contrast poster in **both** themes.
- [ ] Scrolling content visibly diffuses under the glass (not an opaque rectangle).
- [ ] Rim is a hairline on a 3x-density phone.
- [ ] No banding on the blur gradient; grain is not visible as texture at 1:1.
- [ ] Toggling theme or recomposing does not make the glass go flat.
- [ ] On API 26–30 the fallback material renders without crashing and without fake blur.
- [ ] The dropdown panel is glass (not solid): it is drawn inside the screen, not in a Popup.
- [ ] No hard-coded alpha values outside the materials object.

## 8. Report back

State: which files you created, the material values you changed (should be none), and which acceptance items you
could not verify on a device.
